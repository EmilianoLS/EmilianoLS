## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist currently living in Argentina, I'm also an electronic engineer and mastering in management analytics. 
Most of my days I do different analysis and predictive models in python, although sometimes you can see me using R.

As I said, I'm an electronic engineer and a few years ago I discovered the world of data science and never came back. Besides my formal studies, I do a lot of research for new models, new tools I can use to improve my skills.
